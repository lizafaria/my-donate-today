            <h2>Their Lives Depend on <br> Your Donation</h2>
            <p>
                Those with money or power often believe that they can do good by filling some need with <br> material things or simply monetary gifts. While in the short term this may be helpful, this kind of aid <br> is ultimately detrimental to the recipients. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When donations of some material are sent to an area, this automatically erases the need to <br> produce or sell the same object locally. This, therefore, is detrimental to local businesses and takes <br> away the opportunity for individual entrepreneurship.
